# Troubleshooting for people and agents

Start with these read-only commands. A successful condition probe is not proof
that the service/PF is active.

```sh
/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/surge-guard status --json
/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/surge-guard doctor
sudo /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/surge-guard doctor
sudo /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/surge-guard logs
```

The last command renders retained events as readable records with local time,
severity, state/reason and expected/actual routing details. `logs --follow` uses
the same readable format for new events. `logs --json` emits JSON Lines for agents.
Human output names the component and explains cause, effect, remaining apps and
recovery. Raw OS errors, event codes and process/run IDs remain in JSON. The
SwiftBar bridge uses privileged fixed-file reads and unprivileged formatting,
including for historical events. Its formatter is `surge-guard format-logs`.
Old plain-text records stay readable and get a JSON wrapper in machine mode.
Following the log need not print anything new while conditions stay unchanged.
Each component keeps only its current log and one `.1` predecessor, each at most
1 MiB. The system predecessor is `events.log.1`; the companion predecessor is
`gate-events.jsonl.1`. Oversized records are rejected, and no unbounded companion
stdout/stderr file is configured. Existing `service.log` is retained without
further writes after the user service is updated.
Never make the private directory world-readable to simplify menu access.

| Symptom/reason | Check | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `unknown`, `status_unavailable` | Is the new binary installed? Is the system job running? | An old daemon does not publish the new status schema. Install the independent recovery menu first, then update system and companion. Do not label PID-only detection as protected. |
| Permission denied reading status, followed shortly by recovery | Actual snapshot modes and `gate_status_unavailable` / `gate_status_recovered` | A verified writer bug briefly exposed 0600 during Foundation atomic rewrite. Update to the pre-permissioned POSIX publication fix. Do not make the entire private state directory readable or infer a network outage from a reader error. See the permission-window incident. |
| `status_or_pf_audit_expired` | Current PID, boot and recent `pf_unverified`/restart events | Run root doctor. A stale snapshot cannot prove either allowed or blocked PF; do not assume the menu color alone proves protection. |
| `stopped` | `launchctl print system/io.github.surge-guard` | Start the installed service; inspect startup errors if it exits. |
| `service_query_failed`, or old SurgeGate says `stopped` while the guard is verified allowed | Compare both CLI reports and inspect the companion's open descriptors | An unused-stdin pipe leak in the shared command runner caused persistent query failures. Update both binaries; query failures now stay unknown. See [the command-pipe incident](incidents/command-pipe-leak.md). |
| `unlocked` | `manual_unlock` event from this boot | This is intentional temporary removal. `start` or reboot re-arms; `uninstall` is permanent removal. |
| `configuration_invalid` | Validate the intended local policy | Correct the local draft and use `sudo ... configure FILE`. No enhanced-only fallback occurs on damaged installed settings. |
| `rule_probe_pending` | Is a console user logged in? | Wait for the user session and first bounded query. No external HTTP health request is required. |
| `rule_probe_failed` | Error and duration; `surge-cli status`, `surge-cli rule explain URL` as the user | Confirm CLI availability/version and user-session access. Do not run a user-owned CLI as root. Persistent identical errors are not logged every timer tick. |
| `rule_probe_expired` | Are queries slow/hung? | Results older than three seconds from query start cannot open the gate. Check CLI latency and reduce unnecessary checks. |
| `outbound_mode_is_direct/proxy` | `surge-cli mode` | Routes mode requires Rule mode. Change it deliberately in Surge, then recheck. |
| `route_policy_mismatch` | `route_decision_changed` event; expected/actual group and final node | Correct Surge's rule/group choice. When allowed_final_policies is supplied, the node must also be in that list. Omit the field to allow any proxy within the matching group; DIRECT/REJECT remain blocked. |
| Group-only JSON becomes `configuration_invalid` on an older installation | Installed binary version versus new build | Preserve the old policy while installing the new binary; verify status, then apply the group-only policy. Empty/null allowlists are invalid, not an alternative spelling for omission. |
| `pf_unverified` | Root doctor, first-anchor ordering, competing PF users | Resolve the reported PF error. Protection is unknown when PF cannot be programmed. Never flush all PF rules/state as a shortcut. |
| Enhanced mode unavailable | Signature/extension/VIF/default-route/IPv6 fields | Start Enhanced Mode, inspect competing VPNs/routes and rerun the condition probe. |
| Menu has two Surge sections | Existing combined plugin and standalone plugin | Use `install-user.sh --menu-only`, remove the standalone copy and call the renderer once from the combined menu. |
| Parent menu turns grey after a status change on SwiftBar 2.1.1 | Current isolated renderer and the installed user renderer version | Refresh the updated renderer. Parent entries carry primary light/dark colors to preserve SwiftBar's action during incremental submenu updates; changing PF or restarting the guard is unnecessary. |

## SurgeGate

```sh
"$HOME/Library/Application Support/SurgeGuard/bin/surge-gate" status --json
"$HOME/Library/Application Support/SurgeGuard/bin/surge-gate" logs
```

- `waiting`: the system guard has not recently verified `allowed`. Inspect its
  reasons first. A local proxy port being open is not a substitute.
- `unknown`: the guard report cannot be verified/read. Restoration pauses;
  this does not establish that the guard process or networking has stopped.
- `restoring`: some app launches remain pending. `application_restore_failed`
  identifies the bundle ID; absent apps remain pending rather than being lost.
- `ready`: initial restoration is complete. This is not a separate PF claim.
- `error`: inspect the event and configuration. A corrupt session/config is not
  silently discarded. The service retries configuration errors.
- `shutting_down`: a normal OS shutdown request is being processed; wait for
  app prompts. After shutdown is accepted, snapshots pause so an empty desktop
  cannot overwrite the saved session.
- `shutdown_aborted`: no force-kill is performed. The saved session is retained
  and snapshots pause. Resolve the app/PF/permission error; restart SurgeGate to
  resume normal restoration. If macOS cancels an already accepted shutdown,
  restart SurgeGate to resume as well.
- `migration_app_unresolved`: inspect the retained legacy file and replace the
  display name with a valid Bundle ID in the new local config. Finder/Surge are
  always excluded from ordinary recovery.

Do not run ordered-shutdown tests on an unsaved working session. Unit tests do
not send app quit events or request OS shutdown.

## Diagnostics and public issues

Share a small sanitized summary: component version, macOS/Surge versions,
configuration mode, state, reason/event codes and which acceptance scenario
failed. Remove personal URLs, group/node names, app lists, paths and raw logs.
The policy/status files are locally readable and must not contain credentials.

## Recovery

SwiftBar → **恢复与备份（离线可用）** is the first recovery path. It offers a
normal restart with bounded result checks, start/re-arm, trusted backup/rollback,
previous-policy restore and an independent emergency remove-block action.
Legacy guards support restart/start/emergency removal before upgrading; backup
commands are clearly marked as requiring the new system version.

If an update reports a lock conflict, do not repeatedly click forced restart.
An observed failure mode was `bootout` returning before the old daemon finished
TERM cleanup: the updater immediately failed on its lock, then the old daemon
left blocked rules with no loaded service. The fixed updater waits on the real
lock, saves a backup, verifies startup and attempts rollback on failure. See
[the incident contract](incidents/update-lock-race.md).

Emergency removal works without executing the installed guard binary. It waits
for the old PID to exit, clears only `io.github.surge-guard`, then verifies the
anchor is empty. Protection is explicitly OFF until Start or next boot. It
refuses to flush if the previous process is still alive. It never toggles Surge,
disables PF globally, or restores a whole old `pf.conf`.

In a local Terminal, `sudo /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/surge-guard unlock`
stops the system service and removes only this gate. Keep the command available
offline before applying a new policy. The user service cannot unlock PF.

If the binary is absent, follow README's two-command emergency procedure.
Retained policy/session data is separate from public source; do not restore an
old complete `pf.conf` over subsequent edits made by other services.
