# Verification record — 2026-09-08

Environment: macOS 15.7.7, Apple Silicon, Swift 6.0.3, Surge Mac 6.9.1.

Completed without root privileges or changing networking:

- `swift run surge-guard-tests`: all nine groups passed, including 32 readiness combinations, PF configuration round trip/tamper rejection, live-output attachment ordering, route parsing, native PF syntax, command timeout/backpressure, separate stdout/stderr, literal argument handling and protected state-directory checks.
- `swift build -c release --product surge-guard`: passed.
- Release executable `check`: all five readiness conditions true with Surge Enhanced Mode active.
- Release executable `rules`: printed parseable PF policy.
- Build and live-readiness checks do not read a Surge profile or collect node credentials.

Completed with administrator authorization on the target Mac:

- Installed the root-owned binary, PF attachment/default-block file and system LaunchDaemon.
- Confirmed the daemon was running, PF enabled, the guard first among filter rules and the ready-state anchor empty.
- Verified `RunAtLoad` and `KeepAlive`; explicitly cleared the launchd disable override.
- With Enhanced Mode enabled, a fresh IPv4 HTTPS request succeeded (HTTP 200).
- Turned Enhanced Mode off. Readiness became false, and the same request timed out. The request used `--noproxy '*'` and `--resolve` so DNS failure or proxy environment variables could not explain the result.
- Turned Enhanced Mode back on. Readiness and HTTPS automatically recovered (HTTP 200).
- The service remained running with one launch/no recorded exit during the toggle test. Installed binary SHA-256 matched the tested release build.
- Earlier failed startup attempts exercised automatic recovery; the service was unloaded and its blocking rules removed before retrying.

Real-machine findings fixed before successful startup:

- macOS `/var/run` may be root:daemon and group-writable. State is stored under the protected `/private/var/db/surge-guard` instead.
- macOS `pfctl -sr` includes normalization (`scrub-anchor`) before filter rules. Ordering validation now distinguishes the two while still rejecting preceding allow/block filter rules.
- PF's ALTQ warnings use stderr. Command diagnostics are kept separate from structured stdout. PF enable-reference tokens are intentionally parsed from both streams.

Not performed / not established:

- Full application quit/force-quit, existing TCP/UDP transfer interruption, IPv6 transport, inbound acceptance, sleep/wake or actual reboot acceptance.
- Complete automated uninstall/reinstall acceptance or coexistence tests for every other PF user.
- Zero-packet transition latency or zero-leak early-boot protection. Neither is guaranteed by this architecture.

Initial development had no administrator access; the subsequent live test used the macOS administrator authorization dialog. No protection claim is made for the unperformed tests. The code remains experimental; complete [acceptance.md](acceptance.md) for the relevant use case before relying on it.
